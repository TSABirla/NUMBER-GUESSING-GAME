# Number Guessing Game in C

## Description
This repository contains a simple **Number Guessing Game** implemented in C. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides feedback indicating whether the guess was too high or too low. The game continues until the correct number is guessed, and it displays the total number of attempts.

## Features
- Random number generation using `rand()` and `srand()`.
- Input validation for guessing a number within a specific range (1â€“100).
- Feedback for every guess (too high, too low).
- Displays the total number of attempts when the game ends.
